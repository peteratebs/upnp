<p><b><font size="6">Intel Authoring Tools for UPnP Technologies</font></b></p>

<p>The <b>Intel Micro Tools for UPnP Technologies</b> are built tools included 
in the <b>Intel Authoring Tools for UPnP Technologies</b>. All of the source 
code for the Micro Tools is also included within the Authoring Tools, and is 
available for download in the Intel corporate web site at:
<a href="http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/">
http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/</a></p>

<p>Code used within the Micro Tools was generated using the Intel Device Builder 
code generator tool. In addition to Intel Device Builder, some Micro Tools use 
code in the AV Microstacks or Remote I/O Microstacks. The Micro Tools highlight 
just how small UPnP applications can be built, while being completely 
interoperable.</p>

<p><b><font size="6">Intel Micro Tools for UPnP Technologies</font></b><br>
<br>
These applications are compiled for ARM based Pocket PC devices with a similar 
version compiled under Windows is also provided. They have been 
known to work on PocketPC 2000 and 2002 on Compaq iPAQ's and HP Jordana. No 
installation software is provided, simply copy the executables on to the 
handheld device and run.</p>

<p><b>Intel Device Scanner (Size: 60.5k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This simple application allows a user on the PocketPC device to list all of 
the UPnP devices on the network and for each device, which embedded devices and 
services are available. This application is similar to Intel Device Spy, but 
does not allow action invocation and event subscription.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Light (Size: 52k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A simple light bulb device, similar to the one provided with main tool set. 
To keep the application light weight, the screen simply changes color to match 
the switch power and dimmer settings. This application binds it's web server to 
a random port, it's UPnP presentation page will map to the UPnP device 
description.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Media Server (Size: 76k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the light weight version of the Intel Media Server, it provider the 
strict minimum functionality a content directory server must have to pass 
compliance testing. Micro Media Server will share the root directory of the 
device. Micro Media 
Server does no keep any metadata of database of any kind, instead, the response 
to a browse action is built and sent on-the-fly, as file items are read from the 
file system.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Media Browser (Size: 69k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the light weight UPnP AV Media Server content directory browser 
application. It allows PocketPC devices to discovery AV content directory 
servers (CDS) on the network, and browse content starting from the root 
container. This application does not yet allow the user to do anything with the 
content, just browse it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Media Renderer (Size: 149k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the light weight version of the AV Media Renderer. Under Windows, it 
uses the Media Player ActiveX control. Under PocketPC, if uses the Media Player 
Control that must be installed separately. The control is available at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/create/embedppc.asp">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/create/embedppc.asp</a></p>

<p>The Micro Renderer will stream and play audio (MP3, WMA) and video (WMV). It 
does not currently support M3U play lists.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Remote I/O Client (Size: 71.5k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the PocketPC version of a Remote I/O Client what supports the XRT2 
display remoting protocol. This application will make the entire display of the 
PocketPC device available for a Remote I/O Server to remote an application to. 
Once run, the screen will turn black as the application is waiting for a server 
to be available. To exit the application, hit the top left button of the 
PocketPC (the Recorder button). A Remote I/O Server is provided separately in 
the Intel Remote I/O for UPnP Technologies available on the Intel corporate web 
site at: <a href="http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/">
http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Remote I/O Control (Size: 73k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This PocketPC application will list all Remote I/O Clients on the network and 
for each, all available user interfaces for each Remote I/O Client. A Remote I/O 
client can be told to switch to a new user interface by double-tapping on a user 
interface. To make Remote I/O work, a Remote I/O Server is provided separately 
in the Intel Remote I/O for UPnP Technologies available on the Intel corporate 
web site at: <a href="http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/">
http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Intel Micro Remote I/O Server (Size: 81k)</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This PocketPC application will list all Remote I/O Clients on the network and 
make a small sample application available to them. The remoted application will 
simply display 100 random fill boxes on the Remote I/O client each time a key is 
pressed on the client. This server can be used along with the Intel Remote I/O for UPnP Technologies 
package available on the Intel corporate 
web site at: <a href="http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/">
http://www.intel.com/labs/connectivity/upnp/</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Additional notes on running these applications on PocketPC</b></p>

<blockquote>

<p>You must have a network interface card connected to the handheld before 
running these applications. If the application immediately closes, it is 
probably due to problems initializing the network interface. PocketPC 2000 and 
2002 have a problem that makes it impossible to change the selected multicast 
interface, due to this, our PocketPC Microstack will only advertise on the 
currently selected multicast interface. Depending on the handheld, the selected 
multicast interface may be different and change if docked to a host PC. On an 
iPAQ 3835 for example, the handheld must be detached from the host PC before 
running these applications.</p>

<p>When tapping the upper right &quot;X&quot;, the application will keep running in 
background. To completely unload an application, go in the File menu and select 
&quot;Exit&quot;. Applications cannot be loaded twice, running an application again will 
cause the currently running application to be activate and sent to the 
foreground.</p>
