Functional changes between in version 0.2.4 versus version 0.2.3
Date: Oct/22/07

Httpmcli.c - Added HTTP_ManagedClientRequestExExperimental() function. This is used by the
SOAP POST commands. HTTP_ManagedClientRequestEx() is still used for other UPnP client
requests. The HTTP_ManagedClientRequestEx() does not properly include all fields in the content length
because those fileds are appended after it is called. This caused a at least one stack to reject
post meessages.

httpsrv.c
    Corrected error in processing http version numbers..

    Changed:
   if (request->httpMajorVersion >= 1 && request->httpMinorVersion >= 0)
   To:
   if (request->httpMajorVersion > 1 || (request->httpMajorVersion == 1 && request->httpMinorVersion >= 1))

2. In file httpp.c
   At line 746, added WriteString type for 3rd parameter of function
   HTTP_SetRequestHeaderFn
   At line 973, added WriteString type for 3rd parameter of function
   HTTP_SetResponseHeaderFn
   At line 1116, explicitly casted _HTTP_WriteStrLenBuffered to WriteFn

   At line 2370, explicitly casted _HTTP_ManagedClientCookieWrite to WriteString
   At line 2380, explicitly casted _HTTP_ManagedClientAuthWrite to WriteString

4. In file httpp.h
   Added new type defination for,
   typedef HTTP_INT32 (*WriteString) (void* privateData, WriteFn writeFn,
                       void* requestStream);
   typedef HTTP_INT32 (*WriteString) (void* privateData, WriteFn writeFn,
                       void* requestStream);

   To:
   #define UPPERCASE(X) (((X) >= 'a' && (X) <= 'z')? ((X) + 'A' - 'a') : (X))

2. In file fileext.c
   At line 138, inserted defination for .wmv file type
   {"WMV",   FILE_TYPE_VIDEO_X_MSVIDEO},
